### Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)

In computer science, particle cloud optimization or particle swarm optimization (known by its acronym in English: PSO, of particle swarm optimization) refers to a metaheuristic that evokes the behavior of particles in nature.

PSO allows to optimize a problem from a population of candidate solutions, denoted as "particles", moving them throughout the search space according to mathematical rules that take into account the position and velocity of the particles. The movement of each particle is influenced by its best local position found so far, as well as by the best global positions found by other particles as they travel through the search space. The theoretical foundation of this is to make the particle cloud converge rapidly towards the best solutions.

PSO is a metaheuristic, since it assumes few or no hypotheses about the problem to be optimized and can be applied in large spaces of candidate solutions. However, like all metaheuristics, PSO does not guarantee obtaining an optimal solution in all cases.
