# Artificial Intelligence in Robotics

AI code snippets in some important concepts of Machine Learning, Optimization Algorithms, State Management, and Path Heuristics.
This study follows ITA's CT-213 lectures.

## Setup

Setup the environment:
```bash
cd Artificial-Intelligence-in-Robotics
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the code

In order to run the code you need to select the folder of what you want to test and follow its README.

As an example, to run Path Finder:

#### State Management

```bash
cd Artificial-Intelligence-in-Robotics/state_management/code
python state_machine_test.py
python behavior_tree_test.py
```
